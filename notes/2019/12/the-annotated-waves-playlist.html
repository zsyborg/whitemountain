      <p class="big-type"><em>Waves</em> is practically a musical. 
</p>
<p>From the earliest drafts of the script to the final edit of the film, writer-director Trey Edward Shults embedded into every scene his own idiosyncratic, achingly personal song choices. These songs reveal his characters’ inner lives; they are intimate extensions of the images and themes of the film; they’re essential. (Just check out the first line of the script: “<em>Music slowly builds</em> as we pass over pavement in EXTREME SLOW MOTION.”<em>)</em>
</p>
<p>Here, Shults annotates, in order, each of the 39 songs in the film. Listen along as you read and you’ll hear the whole movie in your head.</p>

      <p class="big-type"><em>FloriDada</em> by Animal Collective</p>
<p>I love Animal Collective, I love Florida, and I love the energy and chaos in this song. Waves is about the messy human experience and the dichotomies of life&mdash;pain vs. beauty, good vs. bad, individual vs. family. It’s no coincidence that we chose to just use the bridge of this song. Bridges are a strong visual motif used throughout the film&mdash;we begin and end with bridges. </p>
<p><em>Where's the bridge that's gonna take me home<br>The bridge that someone's fighting over<br>A bridge that someone's paying for<br></em><em>A bridge so old so let it go</em></p>

To me, the repeated whispers <em>"</em><em>Gotta be above it"</em> gives us an inside look into his mind. The first time I heard it, I was obsessed. We chose to combine the studio and live version because the instrumentals were like an overture to the film.<br></p>

      <p class="big-type"><em>Mitsubishi Sony </em>by Frank Ocean </p>
<p>I liked using tracks from <em>Endless </em>in the film because it’s less familiar than Frank’s other albums like<em> Blonde,</em> and <em>Channel Orange</em>. This is the remastered version of “Mitsubishi Sony,” which was one of the few songs that wasn’t in the script. It was originally the extended overture, but the music just fit the film, so when I was editing I decided to throw it in. It feels like the high you get when you are up late partying with the people you love. This song also works in tandem with the kids singing “<em>Shut the fuck up</em>” a <em>Waves</em> original that Alexis started improvising in the car when she told me to “Shut the fuck up” giving her directions over the walkie.

</p>
<p>I remember when this song came on the first time I saw <em>Chunking Express</em>&mdash;I was in love. I think it’s a little bit of an homage to that film, and a nostalgic nod to my childhood. Lyrically, it’s also the next day in Tyler’s life and in our story, we are in church and getting more of a feel for family life. While the lyrics of the song take on a heartbreaking meaning later on in the film, they still also feel hopeful. Even though one mistake can change our lives forever, there is always a new day to heal. After we shot this scene, Kelvin’s real mom started singing this song when he got home. She said she used to sing this song to him all the time when he was little. It felt so meant to be.<br></p>

</p>
<p>This is the first time we hear score in the film, it comes right after Tyler gets the results from his MRI, and we see it instantly pulls him apart. I saved the score until this moment because I wanted it to feel different from the soundtrack. Trent and Atticus manipulated sounds from the film in this track which really brings us inside Tyler’s headspace. The piano is another big element of the score, as Tyler plays we watch his innocence slipping away, while he tries to hold on. This score reveals the internal war he’s having with himself and his emotions.<br></p>

<p>Picking up where <em>Bad News</em> left off, we’ve just witnessed the tense dynamic between Tyler and his dad. A parent’s expectations raging against the insurmountable pressure of success. This was a very personal song&mdash;I still have the scars on my shoulder from tearing it wrestling in high school. My entire world fell apart and everything I had worked for was lost. I took a bad video media class and that was what saved me, it forced me to pick up a camera and film things again. It was a dream come true to work with Trent and Atticus on this film.

<p>This track brings out Tyler’s hurt and regret, dreaming about his lost love as the relationship begins to disintegrate. The shots of Tyler and Alexis through the fire are some of my favorite shots in the film. Trent and Atticus establish this recurring theme, which is heard in two more pivotal moments of loss and pain. Water is such a central focus of this movie, with some of the biggest moments of connection between characters are either in, or near a body of water. It balances the visual destruction of the fire.

<p>This is the first time in the film Tyler truly breaks down. He shows us his vulnerability, and all that he’s been keeping inside. It’s the last moment of deep connection with his sister Emily before tragedy hits and will be an important moment that stays with her forever. The piano melody theme is my favorite of the film because it’s deeply personal to me. Trent and Atticus sent me this track when I was going through a hard time, and I started crying as soon as I heard it. This song is the heart of the film&mdash;beauty fighting through pain, and someone trying to heal. I included the album version of this track here. In the film the track is the same melody but stripped down.

<p>Kelvin took this glorious video of Alexis dancing to this song the first time they met, and so, naturally, the song became part of the film, but it wasn’t originally in the script. You really start to see Alexis’ spirit coming through in this song&mdash;to me, it sounds exactly like a relationship that’s struggling, nearing an end. I like the dialogue happening between this track and the next one, both characters struggling to express how they feel with their lovers.

We tried a million other songs and nothing worked. I wanted the strength and power of the lyrics “I Am A God” right after Tyler overpowers his father.

Playing music on set can be huge in channeling the right energy. In the film, the end of this track goes into Trent and Atticus’ score that again brings us to Tyler’s state of mind. Combining the original and a remix made it feel more unique and dynamic. I like that the lyrics bring us back to<em> Backseat Freestyle</em> and that teenage state of mind.

<p>I am really inspired by Colin Stetson’s work. It is so urgent, primal, and scary. Feels like a nightmare coming true&mdash;a primal howl into the night. I talked a lot with Sterling about this sequence in the film: It had to feel like spiraling out of control, Tyler’s worst nightmare coming true, and the impact this tragedy has on everyone. Both Tyler and Emily’s stories are supremely subjective and strictly from their point of view until we get to the end of each story, when they spiral out of control and we feel the interconnectivity of everyone.

For me, it sounds like the film is in a state of shock, devastation, and mourning&mdash; everyone’s lives changed forever. When I was editing this sequence, I cried uncontrollably for several hours. This song acts as a spiritual transfer from brother to sister. Emily is being birthed out of a tunnel of darkness, and then entering the light to start a new chapter.

This track is what gets us into Emily’s headspace&mdash;isolated and in deep grief. The piano theme used here is her spirit trying to get through. This is the second we use the piano theme; it started in the bathroom with Tyler and Emily earlier in the film. It felt right to use it again here for a multitude of reasons. Even though we’re in a state of grief, the film is coming into a new beginning.

      <p class="big-type"><em>Florida</em> by Frank Ocean
</p>
<p>Maybe Frank has been jumping into springs in Florida and swimming with manatees? I have no idea why this song is called Florida but it was meant to be. Filming this was incredible, we flipped a kayak, I lost my cell phone and wallet, but I didn’t care&mdash;this felt like one of the best days of my life.<br></p>

      <p class="big-type"><em>Rushes (Bass Guitar Layer) </em>by Frank Ocean</p>
<p>This song is Tyler’s spirit haunting the film. I found this instrumental version from live streams before the visual album release. I wanted to bring back the instrumental part of <em>Rushes,</em> so it takes people back to that beautiful moment between Tyler and Alexis in the ocean. It really brings out the melancholy following a really devastating scene.

      <p class="big-type"><em>Bluish </em>by Animal Collective</p>
<p>I’ve had a few people question if high schoolers in South Florida would be listening to Animal Collective&mdash;I think it’s too easy to say they wouldn’t. I know that Tyler and Emily would be. When I was in high school, I was always on the hunt for new and different music, not just music of the moment. I wanted to treat Tyler and Emily’s taste in the same way.

</p>
<p>I love this moment for Emily&mdash;a moment to really let go, and celebrate the high. We wanted the audience to feel that feeling with her. One of my favorite shots in the film is Taylor hanging out the car window, mirroring the same sequence with Tyler from earlier in the film.

</p>
<p>The lyrics in this song have shifted and taken on a new meaning as I have listened to them over the years. In this sequence, we are calling back to one of the opening shots of the movie&mdash;a metaphor for young love. We see Emily and Luke in a similar phase of their relationship as Tyler and Alexis were. But, as an audience, we’re melancholic because we’ve been through this before and lost. Road trips are a very personal memory for me, and they have been an important part of my girlfriend and my relationship. It was important for me to recreate what this experience felt like. I was so naive when I was going to visit my dying father, it didn’t fully hit me until we arrived, I was just excited to hit the road with the person I loved. Working on the sound mix was emotional for me, this scene felt like I was spiritually recreating that experience.

      <p class="big-type"><em>Leaving Missouri</em> by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross
</p>
<p>This track in the score is huge in translating what’s happening to Emily internally. It’s the first time she has been around death again, but now death is connected to forgiveness&mdash;something that Emily’s been struggling with. Not just forgiving her brother but forgiving herself. One family is ending, but it’s not too late to change things with her family. Forgiveness seems so simple, but it can be so so fucking hard.

      <p class="big-type"><em>True Love Waits</em> by Radiohead
</p>
<p>The first time I heard this rendition of “True Love Waits,” I just started crying. Yes, I probably cry too much. I just kept crying and re-listening. I just love that they waited to record a studio version for so long, and this was the result.
</p>
<p>I think they had more to live before this version was ready to come out. At this moment in the film we leave Emily’s perspective because she’s reached a certain place internally. We now start to see how the parents are both dealing with their grief. I wanted everyone to feel connected while almost never actually being together. This film was always meant to be a soundtrack film because of how huge music has been in my life&mdash;specifically in high school. I don’t know a better way to reach the end of the film than using one of my favorite Radiohead songs ever.

<p>I love that this song opens the album, but ends our film. This song obviously speaks to the spirit of the entire film. This song at this moment feels like the much needed hope we need. Emily is on a road traveling forward, knowing it’s going to be a hard road ahead, but hopefully she’s moving towards healing and a new beginning.
