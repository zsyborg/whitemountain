      <p><strong>Sophie Thatcher:</strong> This is Sophie Thatcher.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East:</strong> And this is Chloe East. And today, we're talking on the A24 Podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: How many times have you seen the movie?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East:</strong> Six times.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Six?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Twice as much as me.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Really? So three?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Three. I want to watch with a big group of friends.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I went with my Mormon friends, so I didn't take-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Was that yesterday? Or was that the Vista?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No, I went to the Vista-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Wasn't Christopher Nolan there?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. I didn't see him, but apparently he was there.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's absurd. That's when I was like, I saw Beck and Woods, their Instagram post and I was like, "Oh, this is real." People are-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And Jack Black.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Jack Black. When I think of Jack Black, he sings this Elliott Smith song in an interview and it's the funniest thing in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I love him. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: <em>School of Rock</em> was one of my favorite movies growing up.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. You saw it with your Mormon friends there?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I saw that down in San Clemente. It was so, should we say this for the podcast? I saw it down in San Clemente with all my Mormon friends. Not all of them, a lot of them. And it was such a Mormon screening that there was a baby, like a five-month-old baby, like baby-baby in <em>Heretic</em>, crying.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You do what you got to do. You got to get out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know. It's like, listen, when you're on housewife duties, but you got to see Heretic.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: What did you think of the two Whitneys doing?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, that was so awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And what has the response been like from your Mormon friends?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Everyone has loved it. I can't even wrap my brain around how this happened. Not that I didn't have high expectations for the movie, but it seems like-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It feels surreal.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Maybe everyone's lying.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know. I was like Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, I'm like, "Did Steven Spielberg actually like it?" But it seems like everyone who has seen it has sent me texts saying, "100 out of 10. This was..."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: There were people saying, "This is the best movie I've ever seen." I'm like, "I wouldn't go that far."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's insane.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But it's really, really, it is good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It exceeded my expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know. And it keeps getting, but it keeps getting better each time I watch it. And I do feel like the last time that I watched it, because we didn't have a Q&A after and I wasn't like, "Oh, I'm going to fuck up." Like, "Oh, what am I going to say? Yada, yada." I was able to fully watch it and I finally was like, "Oh, this, the ending is heartbreaking."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Your monologue killed me. I look over to my mom and my sister were both sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. A lot of people were crying at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I didn't think-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It was that emotional of a movie, but I felt at that time because I was finally able to be present.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Even shooting it too, I thought I would hit a wall of cries. And then when we got to that part, I had a whole nother wave of emotion-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because you were so tired.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Just pouring out. I was so tired. And then I realized of all the times I've read the script, I never read it with the kind of, maybe the point of view that you had when you had the cry viewing. It's like it meant something different than I always thought.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Aw.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And so, then I was like-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That makes me emotional now.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: "Oh my God, why am I crying?" And then, Scott and Bryan were like, "Okay, wait, it's not...You don't really need to cry."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: "You can tone it down a little bit."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I'm like, "Wait, but now I'm actually crying." Action. I think it is emotional. I feel like the movie confirms whatever you go in believing in a very comforting way.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I feel like it's different each watch, and it depends on who you're watching it with in the discussion after. Because if you're, I don't know. When I watched it with Austin, we felt bleak the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Mm-hmm. Yeah. There's no hope.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Then I watched it with my mom and my mom was just sobbing and all emotional and hopeful. So I think it just depends on who you watch it with, I guess, or just your mindset before going into it, which is so strange.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But you know what's interesting is when, because every time... So, seen it six times.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Six times?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: The first-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You're probably going to see it more. Because it's been out-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I probably will.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I probably will.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Who do you need to see it with? Who's on your list?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I have a couple more friends in San Clemente I want to see it with, and then just some hometown girls.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Hometown girls.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Hometown girls. And then-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: There's something about seeing it with childhood friends.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I had some childhood friends text me this weekend and it made me emotional that they, I was like, "Oh, you care?"</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: "You go out of your way to see me in a movie?" When the Letterboxd thing came out, it was pretty edgy of me, but I said, "Happiness, Todd Solondz is my favorite movie." And everyone was like, "That's a bold choice. That's pretty messed up." And then everyone was like, "<strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>'s a film bro." And I was like, "I just like what I like."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And then they started going into like, "Oh, they're trying so hard to be pretentious because they're young."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right, right. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, I read all those comments.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I did too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I was like, "Why should I-"</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I did too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I don't care. There was a dark day where I went, I was alone at a restaurant having a glass of wine, and I was like, "You know what? I'm going to go on Letterboxd because <strong>Chloe East</strong> went on letterbox." I was inspired by you. And that was my one rule. I was like, "You cannot look at Letterboxd reviews."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wait, you never had a... I thought you had a Letter-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I had one, but I never looked at the reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, but you didn't look at the reviews. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And my God. Most of them were positive.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was surprised. Because I was like-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. I didn't-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You really can't do that though. And I'm breaking all of my rules because I'm so bored.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Same.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm not working right now. So I'm just kind of like...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Scroll, scroll, scroll.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Scroll, scroll, scroll.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Scroll until you can't scroll. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's really obsessive, but it's been pretty positive, and if anything, it's giving confident...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm really happy for Scott and Bryan, and I'm extremely happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Everyone has just been raving over you.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Kudos to Carmen Cuba. The casting in this and-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Did you know her before?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. So she cast me in a show I did called Generation.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh yeah. She told me about you. And I was trying to look everybody up, and then one of my friends who hadn't seen you in Fabelmans knew you from your Disney show. She was like, "Yeah, the Disney kid." I was like-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Liv and Maddie.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Which is so strange to me. I was like, "<strong>Chloe East</strong>'s not a Disney kid."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Does anyone know you as a dancer beforehand? Because you were pretty, you were-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Okay. Actually, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Amazing. Seeing those videos.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It was insane.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dance was my life.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You were a prodigy.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: The movie I'm working on right now, there's the confidentiality girl who's on there every day putting stickers on everyone's phones. She asked me, she's like, "Were you a dancer?" I was like, "Yeah."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's so strange.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: She's like, "Yeah, I remember watching your YouTube dance showstoppers finals or whatever."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Wow. That's really random.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. She's like, "You danced."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But you were, if you scroll away back on your Instagram, it's all...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dance, dance, dance.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Dance, dance.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dance was my life.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I had somebody comment, Tiffany, she did Broadway for a... You know what I'm talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Cabaret for a Cause.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Cabaret for a Cause.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yes. I did it twice. Did you do it? Did you sing?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You did not.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: What year?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: There's a video. 2012. I sang <em>Thoroughly Modern Millie</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: “Not for the Life of Me.”</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: There's a video if you look me up, and it's just full theater kid. And I'm honestly, I watched it the other day and I was like, "Damn. I was a little prodigy."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That's what people don't know about you.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was a theater kid.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You were a theater kid-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Before I went to the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Belting.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Are you going to do it ever again? Are you going to go back to theater or musical theater?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Musical theater, well, the only one I was up for <em>Cabaret</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I feel like that's the coolest one you can possibly do is going to be in London.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wait. <em>Book a Mormo</em>n musical.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: We're both in it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But sisters.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But sisters.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. It will translate.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>:</p>
<p>Okay, so <em>Cabaret</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Cabaret</em>-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>:</p>
<p>You would've done that?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:I will do that at some point, but it's funny to think about where both of us came from. You were a Disney kid.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Slash dancer, insane dancer, and I was just like a little musical theater brat.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. So funny how it's started from very, not that we've gone to the dark side, but very-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wholesome. I assume you're the same way, but I feel like now I want not nothing to do with... I think as a kid I just wanted to be famous and as a kid I wanted be on Disney Channel.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's what you do.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. It's funny because I feel like I'm at a point where I'm craving lightness. I love...has it been announced what you're doing right now or no?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No. I don't know if it's ever going to be announced or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay. We're not going to say anything. Really?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay. I'm not going to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It might just end up coming out. I don't know. I don't know. It's-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's insane.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I don't even know when we're done.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because I'm so bad at keeping my mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Same.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I also have a very, I'm always jinxing projects where if I get a call back, I'm like, "Yeah, this is the one. My next project." And I did that with this project that I thought I was going to be doing. Didn't book it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, damn.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I just said it enough to enough people where I was like, "Yep."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I feel like that happens.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Something in the air. I jinxed it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:I'm way too superstitious and I was as a kid. And this is some crazy OCD stuff. I would, before auditions, write three pages of how the audition was going to go and be like, "I am going to book this. I am going to..." It was psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Affirmations to yourself or…?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Kind of. I guess it was.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That's interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I've told somebody that and they said that, and I was like, "Oh, I don't really believe in that," but it was kind of from an early age, I would have these tics before going into an audition. I would have to write-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: In the shower how it was going to go, and then I had to say-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You manifested it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You're ahead of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I don't to believe in that at all way, but it was directly connected to my OCD where it was just little things adding up like that, and if I didn't follow these steps, or take a shower before my audition and write that down three times in a row-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Screwed.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm not going to get the audition.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I've kind of calmed down. But I had that where I would have to do a prayer before every show when I was doing this play-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I did that.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: <em>Diary of Anne Frank</em>. I had 200 shows and I did a prayer before every show, and it was just like, "Our Dear Heavenly Father, please bless that this show will go really well. Please bless-"</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I did the same thing with my dance.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: "That the audience will really like the show."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: "I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen." I had had it memorized at that point that it almost felt like a monologue. I remember there was one show where I realized halfway through the show that I didn't do the prayer and I was like, I just had this pit in my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That pit was from not praying. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Not praying. I was praying so much and it's just instilled in you.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, no. Is that a Mormon exclusive thing?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I think it's exclusively Mormon.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I feel like it is. Exclusive Mormon.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Exclusively Mormon.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. No, I'd do the same thing before dance competitions. Or-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Do you still do it?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. I kind of still do. My own version of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I feel like I do it at least once a week.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Still.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I'm like, "Just please."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm really nervous. Or sometimes-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's just like, "Please bless that I'm not nervous." Just something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's almost like journaling too and keeping track where it's just putting it out into the world. And again, I don't believe in manifesting, but apparently as a kid-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Pro manifester.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh no, I was ahead of the game. But I think it was just OCD and high anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I definitely prayed before going into the callback. That was, I think my first in-person callback.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>:Yeah, it was mine too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. I remember just being so nervous. And it's crazy that we've grown up just having to do self-tapes.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because it's such a different experience on set. I personally feel like I'm really bad at self-tapes. For a while I was reading with Austin and he just has a really monotone voice and talks like this.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, same as Ethan. I do them with my dad now.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Your dad?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay. Why is your dad kind of a stage dad?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, yeah. He is. He was-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: He's a stage dad.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: He produced plays in London in his 20s.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's insane, because it's always the stage mom, that you have it reversed.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, my dad, he will read every script within 20 minutes it gets sent to me. My agents will call me like, "Did you read the script?" And I was like-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And you're like, "No, my dad did."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: "No. I'll call Howard. I'm sure he has a debrief on it." And he gives the other movies or plays it's inspired by.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: He has good taste, right?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: He has great taste, yeah. I feel like my taste is owed to my dad.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Grew up with good taste.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: He had a DVD of <em>Seventh Seal</em>. He's like, "All right, got to get into Bergman."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, wow. How old were you when you watched that?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I'm 11. I don't think I watched it, but <em>Woman Under the Influence </em>is one of your favorite movies.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: One of mine, too. My dad, I was working in Canada as a kid, I was 14 or 15. And for my whole life he was saying, "Oh, you got to see <em>A Woman Under the Influence</em>, you got to see this movie, but you're not ready for it." But when I was in Canada for this job, he called me out of the blue and he was like, "All right, you're ready for it. You're ready."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, that makes me want to cry.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, that's beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And I watched it at night by myself.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I've never seen any Cassavetes movie in theaters and there's something really... I know, I know, I know. When I first watched that, because I had to find a lot of stuff on my own, my sister was in a lot of French New Wave, but I was always like, "Oh, that's my sister's taste." But I think for me, it was when I was 15, have you seen <em>Christiane F.</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I watched that really early on.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That's with the Bowie song?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That was the Bowie soundtrack?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was obsessed with Bowie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I remember the day that Bowie died, I think I was 15 or 16. I slept in my mom's bed and refused to go to school for two days as a protest, because I was like, "I love Bowie so much."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But <em>Christiane F.</em>, I remember I would just draw her every day because I was so obsessed with her, and I re-watched the movie over and over. And I found that by myself, I think through Tumblr, which is the lamest thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Tumblr.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, yeah, I was a Tumblr.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Trying to get back on Tumblr.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm still on it and it's still the same username, but it's a great place to find art.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm not even joking. And the fact that it showed me <em>Christiane F.</em>, I had a Shoegaze blog, so I would just post a lot of just music.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:</p>
<p>Facts about music.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>:</p>
<p>Yeah. Was that Woman Under the Influence as well?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I think Ellie, my twin, had superior taste to me and was just always on the internet. And I think we had found Bo Harwood, who died last year or a year or two. He does most of the Cassavetes soundtracks. And Ellie showed me a song from the soundtrack before I'd seen the movie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Which movie?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: <em>A Woman Under the Influence</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It was the like (singing).</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And then I tried to learn that on the piano before seeing the movie. And then finally I saw the movie and knowing, having the soundtrack memorized and just instilled in me made it so much more jarring.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That's cool.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I feel like I've found that with a lot of movies like <em>Mysterious Skin</em>, I loved the soundtrack to that.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Soundtrack to that's great.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: With-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And Brady Corbet's in it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Am I crazy?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, I don't-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yes, Brady Corbet's in it and he has <em>The Brutalist</em> coming out this year, which is one of... And he's a kid actor in that.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You're right.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, God. I really walked up to him, because he was at the TIFF after party for it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I was like, "Dude, I'm so excited for <em>The Brutalist</em>." And I was like, "Oh, God, why did I even say anything?"</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No, I did, too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: He's such a legend.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I just feel like I was like, "I don't even want to say anything."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dude, that trailer is fucking insane.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Insane.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: So fucking awesome, I cannot wait to see it. And they're doing 70 millimeter showings all around. There's a couple of theaters, so I'm going to go maybe next Sunday. You should come.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, to see that would be amazing. What were we-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: The score.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay, fair.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: <em>Mysterious Skin</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: The score to that, I'm trying to think of other movies where it was 20 days later, it was always the score that I was drawn to. And then I would watch the movie and be like, "Oh, this is an amazing movie." But it's interesting that I always, or not always, but usually knew the soundtrack before going in. I'm trying to think of other movies that I found by myself when I was young.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: On Tumblr?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: No, I mean, it was either through my sister or just, I remember when I first got my own Criterion and I would just get really high and stay in bed and try to watch every movie possible.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Like the Criterion Channel or the DVDs?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I paid for a subscription and I felt really adult and I felt really cool. I watched <em>The Double Life of Veronique</em> and I remember drawing Irene Jacobs. I was obsessed. I would watch these movies and then draw the characters and just keep drawing them, because I was so obsessed with their faces. <em>Betty Blue</em>, I remember watching that when I was in Prospect and then I went the next day to Pedro Pascal and I was like, "Guess what movie I just watched?" And he was like, "You're too young for that." Because I was 16.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Was that one of your favorites on Letterboxd?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, it's my-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, you said?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I have a huge poster of it in my music room. I saw Beatrice Doll at a Saint-Laurent party.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, that must've been really cool.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I didn't say anything to her, I just stared at her because I was too scared. I was like, "You're my idol."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And then it's like once you talk to your idol, you know you're going to say something embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh yeah, totally.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: So, I was like, "I'm just going to stare at you from afar and let that happen."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm glad I didn't say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And live with the what ifs.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: The what ifs, because I've had where I've met my idols and it hasn't gone well.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah. I mean, even at-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Or it's the connection that you expect it to be because it feels so singular and then it's not.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I just start saying, "I love you, "I love you."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: "I love you, I love you so much. You don't understand how much I love you."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Who was that for you?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That was Alfonso Cuarón at TIFF, I think. Ran into him at a-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Was that for Fablemans?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No, for Heretic, because I stayed a little bit longer and I saw a couple episodes of Disclaimer. And then I went to the after party or whatever it was, and I just went up to him and I-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I wish I had stayed longer.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I just was like, "I love you, I love you so much. I don't even know what to say to you because I love you so much."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Luckily he thought it was funny and I actually ended up talking to him for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, that's amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And I kind of got past it. But I was like, "I'm just embarrassed, because I can't stop." I also told him-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: No, but that's earnest. It's good to be earnest.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I told him that he has the most attractive, masculine men in his movies, like <em>Children of Men</em>, <em>Y Tu Mamá También</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Children of Men </em>was a movie that I grew up with.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, so good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That I remember being like, "This is peak cinema." And still-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, it's so good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Re-watching it, it holds up so well.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I just don't know how he does those, the one takes. They're so good and they just played it at the New Beverly and seeing it with an audience-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I've never been to the New Beverly.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dude, the New Bev does <em>Woman Under</em>... They had a whole Cassavetes month two years ago and the only movie I didn't get into at the New Beverly was, and I think you'd appreciate both of these, was Gena Rowlands' Q&A for <em>Women Under the Influence</em>, or it might've been <em>Shadows and Faces</em>, but Gena Rowlands was in person. I waited in line for three hours, got shut out. And the other one was Eliott Gould for <em>Long Goodbye</em>. And I got shut out of that one too, couldn't get tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Only two ones that I've gotten shut out.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I've never been. Actually-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Got to go.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I think, have you ever seen any of Alex Ross Perry's movies?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I saw <em>Her Smell</em> there, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah. I remember when they were doing Her Smell for a week.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because he had a Q&A, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And then I went, because I was supposed to be in his movie and then that fell through. I remember, I think that was New Beverly, right? It was New Beverly?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: So I have been.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Because they do, yeah, I'm pretty sure. I don't know. I think <em>Heretic</em>, there's a chance, might go to the New Beverly if we can put in a good word. Because they did it at The Vista, so I feel like it only makes sense to move the print over to the New Bev. I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm sad that I didn't see it at The Vista.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Is it done?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I don't know. I actually don't know, because I used to live a block away from there, literally a block away.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And now I'm really far.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I forget that you're not on the East side.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm in West Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I mean, more in the Canyons.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Canyon.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But every time I come to West Hollywood, I'm like, "Ha, ha."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Every time I pass Erewhon in Silver Lake, I think of you.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, that's so-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I'm like, "The evil place."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: "The evil place where <strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong> goes." Ironically or not ironically? It became just an everyday thing.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, it just happens.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I'm like, "Why do I love Erewhon? It's so annoying." I'm like, "Can I just actually hate this place?" But I keep going back - sushi and a Lemon Perfect water and I don't know why. It's the cheapest drink in their-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It was the CBD drinks.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Which is, I feel like CBD is a myth.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Was it the Recess drinks?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, yeah. They're really sweet vanilla Recess.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: They have really cool packaging.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I love just going to Erewhon and staring at the drink this way. I'm like, "This is so beautiful, I wish this was my fridge."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Definitely don't take a gummy before going in that Erewhon specifically.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because it's overstimulating.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You never know who you're going to run into.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Never. The last thing I can say.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Run into people at Erewhon. The people you don't want to run into at Erewhon.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Absolutely. And then you just hide and hide in a different aisle.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: What's your favorite Lana Del Rey song that isn't Get Free? Are you a Lana Del Rey fan?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I used to love Lana Del Rey and I would do... Wow, I feel like this whole conversation is just going to be about karaoke.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But this is when she was Lizzy Grant. Do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, when she had her bleached blonde hair.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wait, you're saying Lana Del Rey was-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Before she was Lana Del Rey, she was Lizzy Grant and it was kind of the same aesthetic. Very trailer park, very, "I'm in the movie, I drink a Coca-Cola," or diet or whatever the hell. <em>Pawn Shop Blues</em>
is my favorite. You should listen to it, it's honestly really beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: That's your favorite?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, I love Lizzy Grant. I haven't really listened to recent Lana Del Rey, but I've had people, which is a huge compliment when people have listened to some of my songs that I've put out. I think it's just because we both have very low voices.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Low and kind of smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, I'm always like [singing]</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Melty, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Melty. No, I love that.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Gooey, melty. I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And people have been really nice about the cover.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, it's so good, the cover's so good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know. It's been funny to hear the reaction because I know that it is “Fade Into You.”</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I've had people be like, "Ooh, you're going to owe Mazzy Star some money." I was like, "No, that's the point." You should see me, I'm talking. It's an iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: "It's an iteration." Have you seen her movie?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That has been a little... But then I also know it works, it's so clever in the way that it's-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's so good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Did you know Mazzy Star, “Fade Into You?”</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No, I didn't. But then now listening to it, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: If you listen back to back, I think it's the slide guitar.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Is that what Scott and Bryan had in mind, or did they just-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I don't think so, I think it was Kerry.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because originally we had done... It was interesting, I had recorded it in Vancouver.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wait, who's Kerry?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Stacey's husband who worked on the-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It was at Licorice Pizza and he's done a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, I love him. He had a bedazzled hat last time I saw him. He's such a legend.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: He's so nice.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, he's so nice. </p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: He's so nice.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Such a sweet guy.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But I had done it in the studio in Vancouver, and it was a very finger-picking guitar, very uplifting and it was the opposite vibe. And then apparently they weren't totally into that, so we just did Mazzy Star and I remember going into...</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: ... into that. So we just did Mazzy Star. And I remember going into the studio. And I was like, "Oh my God." It sounded gorgeous, but I also think that it's just like it works so well for the end of the movie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: So you recorded it on your own?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I didn't record it, or I recorded it-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You did it in Vancouver though?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. They sent me to this studio. I remember responding within seconds to their email. I was on set and I was like, "Oh my god, this is my dream, just to be able to collaborate in that way."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And even just the more I've re-watched the movie, the more... the guy who did our score does a lot of stuff with Danny Elfman, and it all made sense once I looked him up. I met him at TIFF, and he's so good. But I love our original songs in it. They feel classic. There's something timeless to it, which I love, that it doesn't feel modern.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Because I remember even within that scene with the other... when they pulled down on your pants. I was like, "Oh no." I was like-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Not my pants. I got pantsed, everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Or your skirt.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Don't worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You can't wear pants.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah. That's true. I got skirted.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I got skirted.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I got skirted. I'm sorry. It's so embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But I remember that feeling off because I was like, "Oh, this is a timeless piece." It almost doesn't feel that contemporary, which is what's cool about it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But then he mentions Lando and you're like, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: We are here.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:We are here.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. No, I love your cover. It's so good. I used to just tell everyone that my favorite cover all time was Jerry Garcia's “Knocking on Heaven's Door.” Actually I think it's a Grateful Dead version, not Jerry Garcia Band.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Have you seen the Grateful Dead anytime recently?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I think they'll be back at The Sphere next year. We're going. It's just not even a question. Whether you like it or not, I'm dragging you. It just will blow your mind. The Sphere, Sophie Thatcher, you'd have so much fun. It's not overstimulating, it's perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Sometimes I like to be overstimulated.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, "Just going to have to get some real estate in Vegas so I can go to every single show," because I made it to five shows this past year during the residency. And I'm like, "Five wasn't enough."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Five wasn't enough.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: They have some Cancun Dead Fest, but my dad told me it's really lame and I shouldn't go.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Your dad was a Deadhead, right?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, he was a Deadhead.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: He's the classic, "I've seen the Dead 300 times," like every Deadhead says.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Do you feel like he got most of your taste from your dad? You were saying that, kind of. He's going to be listening to this and he's like, "Haha."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Growing up, I thought the Grateful Dead was super lame. I thought it was super lame.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Isn't that funny how that turns around? Did you kind of discover it by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It is kind of old fart music.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, but it's classic.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>:But I love it. It's so good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:It brings people together.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. No, I remember my dad would play “Stop That Train,’ it was a Jerry Garcia song, in his car growing up on the way to school. And I remember that song in particular, I don't know why, was the only song in the Dead, Jerry Garcia universe that I liked. And so that one just sticks in my mind of... but I don't know. Now that I've been, I feel like, baptized in the school of the Deadheads, and I'm sure my dad's like, "Don't ever say that again. That's so embarrassing. Play it cool. You don't even talk about the Dead. One rule." Yeah, he's probably going to be mad that I'm even talking about the Dead. He's like, "No, you're such a kook." But whatever, I am. And now that I've been to the show and it's John Mayer, I'm like, "Oh yeah, these are some of-"</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, I forgot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: He's so talented.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: John Mayer is one of the most talented people on this planet. And then I'm listening to these Dead songs. And now I'm that old grandpa or dad who's listening to the guitar solos during a Dead song and just like, "Oh, like that. Yes. Let's go, guitar solo. That's so awesome. A 12-minute guitar solo is so awesome."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Did you ever see Freaks and Geeks?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No. I know. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know. I have a lot of holes, and that's a big one.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Well, same. I feel like you've seen all the classic movies. I remember when you were first talking about movies, I was like, "Oh, I haven't seen Lawrence of Arabia."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, it's so good. It's so good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But Freaks and Geeks, the last episode of Freaks and Geeks, Lindsay, the main character, is contemplating whether she goes to this, what? I think college or something, or with Deadheads. The song Ripple plays.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Chills.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: So good.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Chills.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I love Ripple. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I just remember watching that episode as a little kid and sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was, "What is this is beautiful…” and it was only one season, and that's the last scene of the show.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And talking about it now, I'm like...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's the last scene of the whole show, is Ripple?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. That was always my... I knew about the Grateful Dead from that show and the Deadheads</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And the stereotypes about it, but I always thought they were just like...</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: There's a pretty funny South Park episode on not specifically Deadheads, but it's like-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: There's a good South Park episode about everything.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: So funny. I was just watching. It's so funny.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm going to watch that. That's what I was watching in the hotel room. That's my, I said my-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Hotel room. Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Every time. It's the only thing that centers me, is watching <em>South Park</em> in a hotel room. I'm like, "Okay, I'm home."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: What was I watching? Oh, I was watching the episode on Japanese toilets, the bidets, last night. And it was such a random episode that just... usually they have some sort of cultural meaning, and I guess this one does, too, but this one just seemed just stupid funny. Yeah. Really made me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was watching the one about musicals, where he takes to see <em>Wicked</em>
and he's like, "If you see Wicked..." I'm not even going to go into it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I don't think I've seen this one.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You should see. It's very funny.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Classic, classic. But I'm also a musical theater nerd, which is sad to say, but it's coming out into the world.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You cannot hide it. I can't hide it. I can't hide my past.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's here to stay, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I also find it's interesting. I've never had a press cycle like this where I've had to talk about my past so much.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's kind of a mind fuck and I feel like a-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I feel like a giant therapy session.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh my god. It truly feels like I'm discovering things because I'm trying my best to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It does feel like reverse therapy, where I feel really raw after talking about it. And I've never talked about Mormonism so much in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And now that it's such an open thing in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Open discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:Open discussion. And then I'm also trying my best not to offend anyone hard.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right. That's hard.<br></p>
    </div>
  </div>
      
<div class="block text">
      <div class="text-content">
      <p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: So it's just this really weird line that I've never had to deal with during press. I remember being horrified before this because I was like, "How the hell are we going to talk about this-"</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I have a whole notes page of probably 10 pages of every possible question that somebody could ask me.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I thought, going into it, we would do interviews and it would be pretty divisive and-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: They would just say, "How was Hugh Grant? How was working with Hugh Grant?" Which, I have my perfect memorized answer. I'm like, "He's a really funny guy."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: He's funny. He's a genius. Yeah. But it seemed like the movie is accepted from Mormons, ex-Mormons, atheists. It seems so-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. I've seen some hate comments.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: There's definitely some hate, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Again, going back to you can't read comments. My god.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But I'm like, does that say something about your open-mindedness? When I started-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: They probably also haven't seen the movie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: They probably haven't seen the movie.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Exactly. Because it's like, "Well, if you watched it all the way through you would know this is no personal attack on you."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But when I watched it in San Clemente with my Mormon crew, my last time I saw it, what was interesting is in the beginning of the movie... there was always, every other screening I've been to, there's a lot of laughs in the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Especially when they're sitting on the park bench talking about pornography and condoms and elephant trunk and all of that. There were no laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And they kind of trickled in later with the Star Wars or even-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Do you think they found it offensive?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I think they didn't know what was going on. They were like, "This is an attack," or like, "This is..." And I think it's really smart of Scott and Brian, too, because you have this crazy monologue start off the movie.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's such a good start.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's such a good start. And I could see how if you're a super faithful practicing Mormon and watching it, you're like, "Oh, is this going to be a hate fest to my religion and my beliefs?"</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. But it's also uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But what I realized, too, is even when we're about to go in the basement and I'm like, "Thank you so much-"</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I think that honestly got the biggest laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It does get a lot of lot of laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Which is so amazing because you read it on the script and it's, "Thank you so much." Could've been read any way but you, <strong>Chloe East</strong>, brought, "Thank you so much! Thank you so much!" You said it a strange-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It just hits because so it's-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's like the niceties. Being nice to this sociopath.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know. It just hits every time.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But the last screening, there wasn't a lot of laughs during that.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And it usually gets a lot of laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's always the one that hits.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Not that I'm counting laughs, but even when I asked Ms. Reed, like-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You're like, "You got sheet?"</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know. I'm like, "Okay, so volume... not I." But even, like, "Mr. Reed, your house is beautiful. It's like a church in here. Did you build it?"</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Also always got a lot of laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: What I realized with my crew was, they don't see this as abnormal.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That's so interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: They are... almost Paxton. And you would be nice and you would-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, of course you would say that.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, you would say that. And yeah. You leave someone's house, you're always nice. There's this nicety that, it's not foreign. And so I think when other people see it and they're like, "Oh my gosh, how could you possibly?" It's funny to speak to someone in that way who's a sociopath and making you believe that you might be in a lot of trouble. Yeah, the laughs were always other... someone did laugh after the meow and I was like, "Thank you." I love when people laugh at Hugh's meow.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But yeah, definitely that was the most eye-opening screening I had.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: What has been the best screening or the best audience? Because I feel like this movie is very dependent on how your audience reacts.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I feel like the sound at The Vista was game-changing for me. It sounds so good and that audience was really fun.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Did you get to meet people?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Not really. I think I-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Did people recognize you?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I did a little intro. I said, "What's up? Hey guys. It's me, <strong>Chloe East</strong>." But I said a couple words, excited that they had this film print and showing it and whatever. But no, I was wearing my hoodie. I looked completely different than Paxton, but I really don't think... no. No.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Do you think people assume that you're similar to Paxton? I always find that with roles that I play, that people always assume that I'm Natalie. And I feel like it's kind of gotten into my subconscious, where I'm like, oh, this is what they think. It's like they're projecting something onto me.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right. And you're like, "Wait, do I overcompensate for this?"</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I overcompensate and like-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And you're like, "Wait, do I overcompensate for this?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I overcompensate. And try so hard not to be or follow what they're thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, sure. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's this whole dilemma of who am I? But I find that's interesting, where you always play religious characters.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, I have. Just a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And you're not, I mean you are.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But then you listen to this and you talk about the Grateful Dead. It's totally the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. I don't know if Paxton would like the Dead culture.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: What would Paxton listen to do you think? Did you get asked that at all?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I got asked-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Like music specific question that like what Paxton would listen to?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. What would she listen to?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: She probably went to the Katy Perry concert, and honestly, she probably loves Taylor Swift.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Sabrina Carpenter I could see.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay. Very girly.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Girly pop. Go with your friends, wear your sparkles.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Make the sign. Yeah. I think that's very-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: That pans out.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. I think that's Paxton adjacent, which is, that's not me.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was like, yeah it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's so interesting because you're so far from the character, but I think when you're a good actor, people just assume that you're the character.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Like, that is you. Yeah. When I went up for the intro, my friend was like, I don't think anyone's going to know that you're even in the movie because of the way I was dressed I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: They're like, who is this girl in the hoodie?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I was like, yeah, I'm Set Design. Yeah, I don't know. I'm similar and I like Taco Bell and talking about fast food for sure. So yeah, that's definitely accurate. I feel like it's easy for me to play someone like Paxton. I feel like it comes from a real place.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You guys are both open. Oh, totally. You're channeling something.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But it's not me.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's not you. Oh, God, no.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's not me. But are you Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: No. I can be serious, but I feel like she's serious to another extent.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. You're silly.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: She's more rigid.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: We have fun together.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: <strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong> likes video games and karaoke.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know. I like to have fun. I'm playing all these really serious roles.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Even Natalie, I mean Natalie can sometimes be funny.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: We're goobers.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: True. And that's why we get along.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. We're just a couple of goobers. SpongeBob movie.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, wow. I want to re-watch that and cry.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You haven't seen the musical. I would watch that.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, SpongeBob musical?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I have not seen SpongeBob musical but I'm so down. I'm so down to see SpongeBob musical. SpongeBob on Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, it is. It's real.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, that would be legendary. Okay, so you answered your favorite Lana Del Rey song, which is Lizzy-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, Lizzy Grant.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Lizzy Grant.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And it's called?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>:</p>
<p>Pawn Shop Blues.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>:<em> Pawn Shop Blues</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's very sad.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Sounds really sad.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It is really sad.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I guess my favorite Lana Del Rey song, if I'm being totally honest I don't know a lot of them or the names of them.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Summertime, <em>Summertime Sadness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah, I know that one. But I did a dance solo to a Lana Del Rey song, <em>Young and Beautiful</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I think that's what it's called.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? Yeah. So I did a solo to that.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Is this on the internet?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It might be.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You just exposed yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Star Power 2013, walking to the stage Dance Mom style. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Ooh, that's a good question. If you could star in a remake of any movie, what would it be?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I feel like I've tried to answer this before. I don't know. Do you have one? Maybe I can think of one.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: <em>Cabaret</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, okay. Cabaret. There you go.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But the movie is so good and it's so 70s.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's 70s, right? Yeah. And it's just really, have you seen it?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I haven't seen <em>Cabaret</em>, no.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's strangely like Art House at Avant Park.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It is shot in such a strange way. But I would say that, or I'm trying to think. Oh, everyone had an obsession, I had an obsession with Penny Lane,<em> Almost Famous</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I've seen that movie probably more than any other movie. And I remember just as a kid, I was like, I need to be her.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You would be a good Penny Lane.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Thank you. I just want to be a groupie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: All right, manifest. Manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm just a groupie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Those are good ones.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's such a hard question.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's a hard question, but maybe I do like, I was going to say maybe Phantom of the Paradise. I guess it's not the star, or actually, I don't know. Hey, <em>Kill Bill </em>would be fun, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: We'll go with <em>Kill Bill</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: They're going to, in 10 years, swear to God-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Hattori Hanzo sword. Yeah. I'm down. I'm down for-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: ... samurai sword moment. Japan. Wow. There's so many aspects of shooting that I would love.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I want to go to Japan so badly.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Love Japan.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Who would be your dream directors to work with?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I have a pretty long list. I don't want to sound like a complete film bro.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Sound, do it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Honestly, I would love to work with Tarantino.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I know that's not super avant-garde or original.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You should watch him, Fiona Apple is my favorite person ever. Him and Fiona Apple have a lot of funny interviews together.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And they're just the strangest duo.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But you should. And he's just singing backstage to the Fiona Apple lyrics and it's so funny.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wait, that's hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I know. I want to go to the Largo and see them or something.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Oh, that is funny. Yeah, I would love to see that.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Who else is on your list?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Honestly, Alfonso Cuarón.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Who I've already told him I loved him a million times.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Well, maybe that's good you met him.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, maybe. Maybe I manifest, manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Just write it in your journal. Three pages of-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And then he listens to this and he's like that girl's psycho.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I'll take notes from <strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>. I don't know. I do like, kind of controversial, Paul Schrader.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: When does that movie come out? <em>Oh, Canada</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Paul Schrader.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I don't know when that comes out. I don't know. He has some big swings and I loved<em> First Reformed</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I still haven't seen it. That's the movie that people were-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I thought it was awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: ... shoving down my throat that I have to just watch it on my own accord.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I really liked it. I feel like it's really controversial.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Oh, I've heard amazing things.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: But I think it's awesome. And in lieu of Heretic and all, I think it's on brand to do a double feature of <em>Heretic</em> and <em>First Reformed</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Hey, that could be a good double feature.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Double feature.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Hey, let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Who are your directors?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I don't really know. I feel like all my favorite directors are dead.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: But I think that with all my favorite musicians and everybody, because Kelly Reichardt-</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, she's awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: -is really cool. I still haven't seen her Michelle, the <em>Showing Up</em>, so I haven't seen that. But <em>Wendy and Lucy</em> is one of my favorites and I just want to work with more female directors.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Not to sound, but it's true. I just want to experience that because I haven't really experienced that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I have with TV, but TV is such a different beast that's like you don't actually get time to talk to the director.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's like you don't get to know the director at all.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. Those are good ones.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Favorite piece of Mormon lore?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Food, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Food. Okay. Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Mormon. Is that what we're talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Frog Eye Salad is my favorite thing in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's the most random ass grandma food.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I've never had it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: I've never had it-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It is the best thing about being Mormon.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And you told me this while we were shooting. I'm like, I need to try this. I missed out.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And I would always, when I was younger, I was like eight and it'd be like, what's your favorite color? Favorite food? I'd say frog eye salad. I would get bullied so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Favorite food. That's awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: And people are like, "Oh, that <strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong> girl is really quirky." And I'm like, "No, you guys don't get it."</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: She likes frog eye salad. It's savory? It's sweet? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: No. It's so sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Is it Jello?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It's like this tapioca pudding-esque, mandarins.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Damn, I should make it for Thanksgiving. We should make it respectively for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yes. Also, the Jello pretzels. What is that called?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: So good. I don't know what it's called. Whipped cream with the pretzels.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And the Jello layer.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay, honestly, Mormon food slaps.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Slaps. So fire. It's fuego guys. It's fire, it slaps. It's so good. Yeah, I don't even know what that's called. It's just called The Good Stuff. The good Jello-y pretzel-y thing.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: What about Mormon underwear? I didn't even really know what the lore was around that.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Which shows how disconnected I am.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I was like, really? Because people would always ask me that.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Well, even in <em>Heretic</em> when I get skirted, pantsed, that was one moment where I was, especially last time I saw it, I was like this is the one moment that is going to blatantly offend people.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Because they're very sacred. You don't show them.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah. I didn't even know anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And I knew that was going to be controversial, but I'm pleasantly surprised by the reactions by it.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, what have your Mormon friends said?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Personally, I think it is important to show. If anything, you feel bad for Paxton. You're not like, yeah-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Well, you feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: ... look at her magic underwear. But also what my friends who went on missions were saying was like, "Dude, this is totally something that would happen."</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: You experience stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: So it's just for shock value.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: No, I think it's just truth. It just shows what could happen on a mission. And I do think a lot of people, a lot of practicing members, watch it and they do appreciate it and they appreciate the honesty and think it is not sacrilegious to show that or to have that moment. It's up in the air. It can go both ways, but I think it's done in a respectful way and I think it says something to Paxton and Barnes' mindset before they go. And also, you feel bad for us. You're not like-</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: TikTok girls, show those magic underwear. It's like, what the fuck? No.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, it's a different movie.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah. I guess we answered that question. I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Should we wrap it up?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: How do we wrap it up?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Nacho Cheese or Ranch Doritos? I'm sorry, I'm just reading this.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Okay. This is how we're going to wrap it up.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: We're going to wrap it up.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Nacho cheese or Ranch Doritos?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dude, I'm so conflicted because I was in Taco Bell yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: You were?</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: And I asked for extra nacho cheese on my quesadilla and I also got a Doritos taco, which isn't Ranch Doritos, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: I'm going to do Nacho Cheese.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Yeah, I think I'm going to go Nacho Cheese. Especially the Taco Bell nacho cheese, which is next level.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: My boyfriend's car exploded in the Taco Bell driveway, so we're not allowed to go to Taco Bell anymore. We don't talk about Taco Bell.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Wait, when was this? What?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: It was like a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: Dude, Taco Bell will forever be in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Yeah, haunting us.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe East</strong>: It's like big moments in our lives. You can't escape the bell. I'm going to get a Taco Bell tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie Thatcher</strong>: Just end there. I think that's a good note to end on. That was fun.</p>
