      <p>A truly special conversation between Queer star Jason Schwartzman and his old friend, Golden Globe-winning star of The Brutalist, Adrien Brody.</p>

<div class="block text">
      <div class="text-content">
      <p>Topics covered include: the strength and fragility of László Toth, chunky old tape recorders, Adrien’s Hungarian grandfather, heavy accents, giant dictionaries, descending from immigrants, the photography of André Kertész, 3-4 hours of prosthetics for <em>Queer</em>, the transformative experience of making <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>, emotional truths paired with broad f*cking comedy, walking all over India barefoot, digital and analog instruments, loving gear too much, and Jason telling his 10 year-old she can’t come to <em>The Brutalist </em>because she could barely get through <em>Wild Robot</em>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>We've begun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> This is Adrien Brody.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: This is Jason Schwartzman. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>And we are here on the A24 podcast, which I might add is quite ingenious.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: As you are in an A24 film.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: And I just happened to be in an A24 film.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: How crazy is that?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: And you're wonderful.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: And you're wonderful.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Well you're wonderful in it. You were unrecognizable at first. You were so free, and you reveled in that freedom, and it's a funny thing and I've seen you in lots of work, but obviously, we've worked together with Wes so many times. And I love the specificity of Wes's work and what it brings out in language and mannerisms, et cetera. And it was so nice seeing you in this other landscape, so to speak, right-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... and I loved it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I really loved how at ease you were, and it was great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I got a kick out of it primarily because most of our interactions are working together with Wes, and that even off-camera dictates a certain kind of rhythm in all of us, because we're in this kind of universe, and you were in this entirely different-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: That's so interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... space, and I got to watch you from a new perspective as a great actor-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Oh, wow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... and doing your work completely free of any of that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Wow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>And I thought it was really special. I wanted to share that with you anyway, even if we weren't doing a podcast together.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>That's amazing, wow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>But, I do think that it's really-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>That is so kind of you to say. And I feel like I just saw your film last night, and it was such an interesting feeling watching this movie, because I'm sitting there going, I felt so much love, and curiosity, and mystery about this person. I've never seen anything like it. I mean your performance is next level. To me, it's like I feel like it's the kind of thing that you see people do when they have a really incredible game where they go, he hit 10 RBI's, he made history that night, you know what I mean, where someone does a, where they get into a flow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, there was a lot of flow in this. Thank you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>I don't know how to say it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>And I hope I'm not being indiscreet, but you wrote me the most beautiful note ever yesterday after the screening, and I just was really moved by that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Oh, man.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I was very moved by that, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It was funny. I was on my ... On the way home, I was in the car, and sadly there seemed to be an accident on the freeway, and so, everything was at a dead standstill. I just was sitting in this-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Contemplating.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>... car that wasn't moving for a long time, just looking out the window, just thinking of-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>A second intermission.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah, and it was an amazing thing to have this moment after the movie by myself in this vehicle looking out, just thinking. And I have so many things that I would want to ask you about, and so many things I'm just so curious about, and music, and just everything that we want to talk about.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, same here. Yeah, I'm really grateful you were there last night.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Man, I'm just so blown away by it. And I wish I had a thesaurus at times like this. What I love about the movie too is, before the movie starts, you know this, something has happened. And then, when the movie begins, he's beginning this new life, and he's having setbacks, but things are going well ... Things are moving along, and you know that something's going to ... I felt this at the intermission. I felt this terrible feeling.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong>Foreboding.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yes, and I just thought it was so amazing how it was structured that way, because I really felt like, oh boy, you know what I mean? And I was like, okay, this was almost at the beginning of the movie, the whole first part of it, I'm sandwiched between the past, which I haven't seen, and the future, which I don't know what's about to happen yet. And so, I was stuck in this thing, and I was just sitting there. Everyone got up, they all go. I'm just sitting there like, holy shit.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I find it the same way. I can't get up anymore.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>I couldn't move. Yeah, I was like ... And I was just sitting there going, what is going to happen now? And anything could happen now, and I just thought it was so beautiful and I thought, what's fascinating not to ruin things. Is it okay if I talk about the end of the-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, you can talk about anything, I think.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It's at the end of the movie, the speech that your grandniece makes, you learn so much more about your character at the very, very end. And I even thought ... I thought that was an incredible thing too. We've gone the whole movie with you-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>That's very interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>... and learned so much, and then, she makes this speech at the end, and it's like one last thing that you, and you're like, wow. And then, look at the look on your face when you're sitting there, and it's like, oh, my God. And the other thing that I thought was so crazy was imagine if you were really at one of these, at someone's retrospective like that. That's just one building in their life. And you think about all that, and you think about when you walk through all these artists, a retrospective of any artist, each of these, and there must be one of those stories.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, I think it speaks to what we all yearn for as our artistic people, and is to, at the end, the end of that road, of this journey of pursuing creative endeavors, what is left behind, and what we are sharing, how those works speak to one another, how they open conversation. And I know my mother who's such an influence-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Of course.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... for me as you know.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Tell her I said hi.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, I will.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>She's the best.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I just told her I was coming-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>She's the greatest.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... to do this. She thought, oh. She says hi too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>She's number one.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>But, she spent her whole life towards her work, and leaving behind something, and I really relate to that. And also, the fact that she, to play Laszlo, and to reference my grandfather and his journey as a Hungarian immigrant fleeing war in Hungary in 1956, and being a refugee, and having language being an obstacle in his new life, and starting again in America, and all of that. It was so moving to unearth the past within context to my own life, and my own journey as an artist, and my own good fortune, to have been born an American, to be an American actor, and not facing ... I could have been Hungarian, I could have been born in Hungary, and working on my accent so that I can hopefully come to America, and get a role that ... It's just so hard. It's so hard for people with that additional burden. And I really understand that and respect that, and-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>You felt that. I felt that in the movie and all these scenes, he's Peter Pipe when you're constantly working. It was like a-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>It's a funny thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Isn't it great?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>It's a very-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>And just he's saying I will. He's saying we will. And he repeats it over and over, and I love it because this person is-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>They always inverted it. My grandparents always, and my mother still does. It's always the W and the V, they're opposite. They're always inverted-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah, it's a-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... so it's a little familiar to me. I know it so well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It's just beautiful. And also, what I also just keep going, but what I said-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>You are.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>I was sitting next to people I didn't know, people I didn't know at the movie, I didn't know who I was sitting next to last night. But, when it was over, I just was like, here, I'm just going to tell you everything I think. And I was like, I love this character because he's so strong, and I trust this guy so much. And yet, it was a pond with a thin layer of ice. He would break, so he broke quickly, which was so amazing, and so shocking to see. And I was wondering just on a technical level, I was watching it going, this scene is crazy. They haven't cut. They've done this whole thing, and now look where we are. All in one, and I'm watching it, and it's like you see this character one thing. And then, it's like when they pour the water over the marble, that's your character.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And I'm just like, you would just break in a moment. And it was just so beautiful, and I really hadn't experienced that in a long time where it really was watching. It felt like sports, like I didn't know what was going to happen. I also just love, by the way, in the movie, there's so much that the director kept in of people walking to where they're going, because I feel like in so many movies people just cut.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Right, right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> They just cut until they go, let's do this, and they're just. But, I love these long-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>That's true. I know what you mean, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: And this process of getting everywhere, I loved seeing it, because that's what ... To me, the story was everyone getting somewhere. And I loved those moments just following when there was no talking, walking from one room to another, to another, to another. It was really ... It was refreshing to see that and just beautiful, and it's funny, because ... Did you have a lot of ephemera and stuff, or relics, or archives of your life, of your grandparent?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I have deep, deep memories. And we have some stuff. I actually have, which is fascinating, and I don't know why he did it, but I remember ... Remember those old rectangular tape recorder with the cassette-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Of course, yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... with the push the red button to get in the record mode?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Really chunky.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Nice. That was very practical, everyone had that. That's how you would record something, a built-in mic. My mother has a recording. I don't know if she recorded it, or my grandfather had recorded it. But, I remember him trying to get work. He aspired to be an actor too, but he was trying to get work, and he had a recording of this. And I've heard this recording, and he sounds very much even more extreme than Laszlo's accent. And he would introduce himself and Plachy, my mother's maiden name is Plachy. He would say "Plachy", and say it again, "I would like to apply for the job."</p>
<p dir="ltr">And you could hear the pause on the other end of the line, and he would say, "yes, okay, thank you. Thank you." And you could hear the rejection, and he'd call again someone else. And I really remember what a struggle it was to go from ... He was a very charismatic man. He was very handsome, and he was very ... He had quite a life there to go from that, the hardships that they endured. There's so many details that are very personal that aren't really just for public consumption, but are extremely vivid still. And he passed away when I was, I think I was seven. And I remember, he-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... was there teaching me how to ride a bike. I remember my dad taught me, but I remember when the training wheels were just off, and we were on my block, that I grew up in Queens, and he was there. Anyway, it's very interesting. It's very interesting. And that stuck with me and many stories. But, we were such a close family. My mom was an only child. I'm an only child. My grandparents were it from the old world. And it was so ... And maybe because they sounded so distinctly different, it struck me even more than anybody else. Just nobody sounded like them. Everybody was Hungarian. And so, to be able to have that as a guiding light in this, it's really special. And to represent that, because I feel like that is such a universal thing. There's so many people from whatever background we are. The family, and my family, we're all the descendants of immigrants.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> And there's been a lot of struggle. No matter how you cut it, no matter who it is, there's a lot of sacrifice, and it's another world. And it is another world again. Anyway, tell me about how is it-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> And that's why it felt so much more killer by the way, when she says, Felicity says, "This place is rotten." That really broke my heart when she said that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Well, the disconnect between the American dream and the hopes and dreams of people coming here, and to see the destructive forces of greed, and capitalists, extreme capitalist greed is very hard.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I know what you mean too, because my grandparents on my dad's side were from Warsaw, and so they had thick Polish accents.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, my dad's side is also from Poland.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Oh, really? Oh, wow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I don't know specifically if they were in Warsaw, but yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: And so, that accent, it's like this Polish accent, and growing up in their house, and they played Scrabble every night. That's how they learned. And I remember the dictionary was such an important thing in their house, a huge dictionary. And I remember as a little kid, I didn't know a word, and then my grandpa said, "Look it up." And we went over and it was a little magnifying glass, and it was like, you have the power to look up these things in this book. This is the language, and this is English, and this is this. And it was like, I remember at a very young age, like four or five, going to this giant dictionary with my Polish grandfather, and just the importance of words, and how it's there for you to learn, and it's there.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> That just reminded me, in the scene where Laszlo is presenting to the town, the model. I added when I asked Gordon, my friend for the flashlight, the torch, I added, "what is the ... Can you pass me the ... What is the torch?" Because my grandfather, I added that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I love that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Because my grandfather would have a hard time remembering the English word for things. And he would say, "What is that? What is the word for the, what is that?" And I did that-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I love that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... to honor him-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> That's crazy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... because it came to me because they were calling a torch. I changed it to torch. I think it was originally ... I'm not sure, but I believe it was flashlight written in. Torch.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Even just that little line, it was like, I remember that scene, and then you take it and you say, and I was like that felt so ... It just felt so real to me. It was crazy to say that I know you, but then also really to be like, man, I really don't ... This is a whole other person. And by the way, this character-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I felt that about your performance.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: But, this guy's so funny.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I want to get to you, so I appreciate it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I love how funny your character is too. His ability to laugh, and make jokes, and understand the moment, or when to leave a room when he's getting yelled at in the beginning. He's like, "Let's go." I love his skill. He's got an amazing-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> There's an awareness.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Awareness, yeah, it's very interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It's a lot of experience he's lived in, and-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... has seen it a lot. And that I think gives you perspective to say-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... I'm not going to get into it, but I'm not going to take it, and I'll see you later.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Exactly. Yeah, I love, there's a part two ... I fucking love so much when you are walking with the son, and he infers something about your niece, and you look at him, and he's looking all around, and you're like this. And he's staring at him, and I thought, this is amazing, because he's like I don't give a fuck who you are.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I'll lose this whole project right now, burn it all down.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, and I was just like the-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I relate to that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, no, but I loved it, because I loved the idea that at the end of this, this is a decent man, but who's also-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Very complicated and flawed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yes, totally, you know what I mean? And he's an artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah, so speaking of flaws, tell me about this of Joe, and how this came about, and how specific all these nuances that you were doing, and what did Luca push? I love his work, by the way. I love his work. He's such a wonderful, sensitive filmmaker. I really love what he does, and-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I know.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... I've spoken to him. I've not had the privilege of working with him, but I shared with him. I know I would love to work with him, but I think-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> You would love it, because he-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I met him through Tilda, and he's just really special.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I think the way he communicates his ideas, he's Italian, and the way he speaks is sort of poetic ... I like the way that he's getting to what he's trying to say. I remember one day he said, "Can you enter the scene and go like badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop?"</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> That sounds like a Wes note.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> But, I got it. But, I got it. I was like, badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop. It had a little Italian in it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I get it too. I love it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: And I was just like, got it. I mean, I hope I got it. But, he called me. He had read this book when he was a teenager, and it was a very important book to him. And then, he had this ability to make it, and would I play this character, Joe, who's at this bar? And he said, "We would want to do lots of prosthetics on you."</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It was fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It was fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It was amazing. It was crazy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I didn't know it was that at first, and I was like, I hadn't seen you in a while. I was like, yo, you went in. I was like, Jason. I was like, what?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> At first, I had this fear people were going to be like, doesn't look any different, but then I-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Get out of here.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> But, I had never done prosthetics before. It was like four or five hours. This guy Jason Hamer and holy cajoles. But, by the way, I was ... On a side note, I was thinking about your mom, and I was thinking, because I love André Cartage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I mean, I grew up going to his-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I did not know that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... going up to his apartment. He mentored her.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Check this out. I could look up when it was at the LACMA, but 15 years ago or something, there was a huge retrospective of his. It was my birthday that day, and I was just having a weird day. I didn't want to be around anybody, whatever. I just drove to the LACMA.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Parked, went in, and there was a huge ... Retrospect, I'd never seen his stuff. I stayed-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It's so amazing, oh no, he's amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... for hours, and bought every book, and he has one photograph that to me is my favorite photograph of these people in the rain with umbrellas. It's taken from above, and there's a big white arrow on the ground, a traffic sign, and I have a picture of it, and I have-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> He loved my mom.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> That's amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Always, yeah. We have a great picture of his of her on the sofa. That's a famous picture of his that he recreated or did with her like they were kidding around.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Oh, really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, there was all of that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I can't even imagine.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: We don't have the time to delve into-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I can't imagine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adrien Brody: ... all of that artistry, and he's just an amazing human being. But, all the stuff that my mom has seen too. I grew up with her photographing Basquiat, and Warhol, and Keith Haring drinking a Corona in front of a nightclub in this cool patchwork jacket. And I'm like, this is my city. This is the New York that I grew up around. And I'm like, man, it's just Times Square, that era. Just that's the stuff that made people want to make movies and talk about the complexities of human-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> These images are-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... condition, and the sea of humanity there. It's just amazing. She captured all of that. Not to digress, but ... Tell me about Luca, yeah, and how Joe-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> This guy, so this guy basically, no, it was just very simple, because we're talking about it for two seconds, because it's not. I had never worn crazy prosthetics or anything, and he had said, "Would you like to do it?" I said, "Of course. That sounds wonderful." And I had never really done full where it was completely covered, my hair-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It's claustrophobic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I didn't feel claustrophobic when I was in it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: When they were taking it off.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I felt when they were putting it on, you really start to notice certain things. I was trying ... That was the hardest thing, was trying to budget my-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yes, I know it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... my head space, you know what I mean?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I know it very well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, it's like how do I budget this?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: The reason I say taking it off, because mine's gone by the end of the day, and I've poured all the emotions in, I just don't have a lot of space for-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, I know. Rip it off.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Someone just ate a tuna sandwich, and smoked a cigarette, and breathing on you, and they're this close, and there's four people because you turn around, and you just cried, or you're spent, and it's just ... That's the hard part about prosthetics.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Exactly what, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Then that's when it's claustrophobic because you need them to take it off. You can't just get home.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I know. The weirdest thing for me though was that because I was all covered, people would come up and they'd say, "Make sure that you're drinking water because, how are you doing? Are you hydrated?" And I was like, "I'm fine," but I didn't realize that this is not my skin. I was looking to see if I was sweating.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Oh, wow. That's amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>And I realized ... Yeah, and I was like-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> That's amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: And then I realized after the first day, oh, I'm under here, and I am sweating profusely, and I'm entirely hot and uncomfortable. I wasn't in touch with it, because I was just basing it on how I was on the outside, and it was just fake.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Just got to think about that you're nuts and that's it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, exactly, yeah. It was such a fun character to do. And Daniel Craig is amazing, and Drew Starkey in there-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, he is amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... and they're really also ... We had just started, they had just started the movie, so we were doing this stuff, and then I knew it when I was done, they were embarking on this whole other journey. And so, for me, there was a real playfulness, and nervousness in the beginning and fun. I loved how they limited what I could do physically.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Just prop you up somewhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Exactly. And I loved it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Was the belching and all that a scripted thing?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, that's all scripted.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: You did it well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah. No, that was all scripted. But, it's one of those things where it was scripted, but I knew it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, you know the nuances, the nuances to when and how that are fun to work with.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It was fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I know. I could see you enjoying yourself.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I loved it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: That's what I said. There's a freedom in that-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I was frightened-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... that I don't get to see you do, and you do so well, and you should make sure you-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I want to keep doing it</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... do a lot more.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I will spread this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Spread your wings.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yes. Well, I had fun, and maybe one thing that had to do with it was just before that movie, I had never really done back-to-back things really. I've never had ... And I had just done something before that that was very down. And so, I knew going into that, that I was going to play. He was like, he's full of life. He's fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It helps to shed it, no? It does really.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yes, and in a weird way, they almost went together. I've never had that before, but in many ways that was informed by the one before it, because I knew I was just so down in this other one, that in this one, I could just go just go, be wild, and crazy, and fun, and upbeat, and it was nice to do that. It was fun, and I love working with those people, and I love the artists in Tena Cheeta. I love all that's built.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I think that, that is a real special experience and must be special with Luca's guidance, of course.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Even the outside was built inside, which was so crazy. The streets were inside.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Were they?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Outside the restaurants and stuff.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, so where the dog's wandering through-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... and the depth of field where you're seeing all that, that's an interior/exterior shot?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yes. And I had never worked that way.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> There is a certain look to it that I-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Because we do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> You can tell, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I couldn't tell it was inside, but I was curious. I had to look it up, but I was curious where you were shooting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Wait, can I just totally pivot to one other thing, because we're talking about one thing to another?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Sure, sure, sure.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Did you just finish a play?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah. And it's funny, because you were ... I didn't want to get back into let's talk about me, because you've been very generous, and spoke a lot about this film-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>No, I just want to talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... and I appreciate that. But, I just got off the stage four days ago, and went to New York and came here, and we were doing eight shows a week.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: That's insane.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: And interestingly, because you were saying it was nice to shed this other role that was a bit heavy, and jump into something new. And I have not done a film since the Brutalist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I took a bit of a break, and then, we also were subjected to a writer's guild strike, and a screen actor's guild strike that we had to stand by, and so, not many people were working. But, I took a bit of space, and I had not done a play since I was a teenager really. Something I'd been yearning to do, but had been quite, intimidated isn't the right word. But, even though I started in the theater, and doing off-Broadway, and many years in acting school, it's been so long, and I've developed a lifetime of technique and familiarity with film acting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don't really like the idea of projecting. I like the intimacy that we're afforded to speak in film, and listen, and not have to make sure someone under an awning, or up in the balcony is going to hear or see something. It ended up being a really wonderful experience. I learned a lot, and loved the community of actors I was working with. That was really the best part, was sharing that time together with actors who were all so good, and everyone lifting each other up, and all there for the right reasons. You can't make a living doing theater, but you can sure get a great deal of fulfillment, and they're all really ... Everyone's lifting each other up. And I just loved that. And also, this kind of communion with the audience, and how it varied every night. But, all of that was a tangent. The thing that occurred to me is, in addition to doing eight shows a week, the Brutalist has received quite a bit of appreciation after Venice, and I'm incredibly grateful for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My responsibilities in helping to make people aware of the film started ramping up during the play. And I found myself talking a lot about Laszlo, and this journey, and thinking about Pennsylvania that time. And it occurred to me, the character that I play in this play is ... It's based on a true story. His name was Nick Yaris, and he served 22 years on death row in Pennsylvania for a crime he didn't commit. And so much about it was this man enduring great injustice, and violated by people and circumstances within Pennsylvania. And that is Laszlo's, where he lands, and much of his experiences exists within Pennsylvania, and all those hardships. And I was like, what is it that's drawn me to these two things at the same time in my life?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> They both came at the same moment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Isn't that interesting?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: And maybe that there's just too much injustice in the world, and maybe that speaks to me, and just interesting timing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: But, you're able to express it without it ... How aware are you of injustice, or a statement like that, or wanting to-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It's not ... Yeah, I know what you're saying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I don't have the correct wording.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, well, first of all, it's embedded in the work. It's in the writing, it's in the subtext. It's just what speaks to me, and what I find compelling, and worthy of all the work that it takes to delve in. And it takes someone like Brady. It takes a filmmaker who has this, first of all, a sensitivity and understanding of these circumstances, and a sense of empathy, what so many people struggle with in this world, and an understanding of history, and an ability to weave the traumas that many have endured, and are forced to contend with from the past, and where it still lies within society right before our very nose.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To do that without saying I'm teaching you anything, but just, you're going to feel something, and you might recognize something. And I think that's the beauty of film, because you are transported to another era, and the beauty of being an actor, to inhabit and represent someone from another time, and how that individual's experiences speak to elements that you relate to personally, and that definitely other people may relate to, and that it's all in there, baked in, and then you're in this darkened room together, and it unfolds. And it's very special. When it works, it's very, very special.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: And you can feel it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It's very special. But, the play afforded me that as well. And I'm very aware of my own good fortune. I'm very aware of how our lives have many challenges, but I grew up in Queens. I grew up around a lot of people that had made some pretty big mistakes. And this story in the play was so much about a man, a young man who had made a couple of mistakes, and then got implicated into things that he didn't even do, and was too naïve, and addicted to methamphetamine as a teenager, and just a mess, but wasn't guilty of the charges that he was incriminated for, and was helpless, and that this giant system, just oppressed. We could do another podcast because A24 has a whole other movie about injustice within the ... We could bring in a third person into this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Was it hard physically to do it like to have a whole day free, and then, do your job at night for this?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Well, we had eight shows, so we had Thursdays and Saturdays a matinee in addition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Oh, wow. Oh, wow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It never really felt like I had a whole day free, because I also haven't been able to sleep well because I'm, I think, retaining an entire play with the whole third act being essentially a lot on my shoulders that I would wake up numerous times in the night with dialogue, various scenes every night, making sure I know it, or I don't know what it was, but I've never experienced that ever that I can recall.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Maybe there'd be a big scene, and I'll wake up, and I'm stressed, and I'll run the scene before I'm fully up, or I'm making sure I know the monologue, and I know the bridges within that. But, not an hour and 45 minutes worth of material. I had a play with no intermission and a film with a-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> How funny is that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... with one.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> How weird is that?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It is also very strange.<br></p>
    </div>
  </div>
      
<div class="block text">
      <div class="text-content">
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>And then, how did that come about? Someone said, "Would you like to be in a-"</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, Lindsey Ferrentino wrote it, and she's an amazing writer. You just would love it. I should just give you the script.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Will you do it here?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>We'll see. I think it's gotten very well received.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Would you do it?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: She'd probably like us to do it. I'll consider it. I'm not sure yet. It's a lot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It's a lot, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It's a lot. But, it was very gratifying. It's just I got to get a movie going. I got to find a film and then let's see if I find the right film, and right project, and filmmaker, and feel like I have something meaningful that satisfies that, then I can say, "Okay, I'll take another break and space to perform and do a play." It's such a different set of challenges. You make a movie, and you have these handful of scenes that there'll be many that you really relate to, and then there'll be a handful of scenes that are complicated that you know are going to be some work to suss out, and maybe the filmmaker has an idea for them, and you're not sure you understand that well enough, or you're not going to be able to convey it. And then, when you get to that, you tackle that. You hopefully prevail, but you get through it, and it's the past.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Tomorrow, you buckle up, and get to work, and work on the day's tasks. A play, you have to unearth that, and discover it every day, all through rehearsal, and then, in front of an audience every day. And then, even though that may be a difficulty, you've got to be so rooted, and you got to jump right into the next thing, and the next thing, and the next thing. And you have no time to think about how or what. You have to process it, because you do have to learn from it. But, it's such a different way of thinking and applying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>You mean letting that night's performance go to the next night, or scene by scene?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, scene by scene, and processing how to be better again.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Again, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>But, getting through those challenging moments, and then, being fully present in the other moment that immediately proceeds or follows is a new thing for me. I had not had to think on those terms, because I'm so used to compartmentalizing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Say, "We're going to do this heavy scene today, and we're doing that, and then we might have a lighter moment right after that," but, I'm going to put it down. I'm going to go outside. I'm going to shake it off a bit. I'm going to do that." You don't have any time to shake anything off, anyhow.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Did you ever watch a video of it in rehearsal, or did you ever see it filmed?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: No, I did watch the understudy run, which was-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... informative. He was quite good. He was quite good, and I learned a few things. I joked with him. I was like, "Okay." I got to watch the play unfold. I got to watch what everyone was doing. I got to watch what my character wasn't experiencing, and seeing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I got to watch blocking.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I got to see where things needed to be more specific, and for myself, and it was good. It was helpful.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> That's so interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, I liked it. It was very interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Wow. That's really interesting. What about-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Let's talk about music, right?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, perfect.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I want to talk about music with you, because we both love making music. Jason, when he's on set or the last one we did with Wes, we all live ... Wes's family, usually everyone gets ... We all live in one hotel, or sometimes a house, which was amazing on Darjeeling.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> First of all, Darjeeling was just such an amazing, amazing life experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Same.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>We have to talk about that a little bit just because-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Same, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... that was my first meeting and introduction to you, and to Owen, and to Wes, and to Roman, and Jen, and all of you, and the love, and camaraderie, and intimacy of what that was, the familial quality of what it was. And I think more than any other, maybe Rushmore was different. It was different, but it was an earlier time in Wes's work. But, more than the other films that I've been fortunate to participate in, I felt like there was just such a close emotional journey within the humor, and his wonderful, unique stylistic choices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, no, you're right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I love the emotional truths that are hand-in-hand with broad fucking comedy-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... amazingly fun stuff. And these epic, brilliant moves.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Bob Yeoman was shooting, and Wes is designing and man-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: But it's funny, because I think that also was the first time that he had really worked that way too. I think that he was trying that after Life Aquatic, so I think that there-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: And it stuck.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: It stuck. But, I think that was the foray into it. And so, I think in many ways the family thing you're talking about, that was the first time ... It wasn't really. I had never experienced that either.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I never ... I had once, only once. Or the family everyone together. You mean that kind of thing?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Like that yeah, and you and I going on a-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I had one specific to the storytelling, but yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I just had never done so. And so, for me, it was just a dream. We went on a hike around the lake on the first day.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, that was the first day we met. I loved it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It's just so-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Bal Samand Lake.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah. I just remember so much about that. It's hard to forget, because that's like... And just what I learned, and your generosity-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> And yours.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... and the whole thing was just like, I was just so grateful. You talking about grateful, just like every second, I was just like, holy shit.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Oh, me too. Those were life experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>And I loved it. And I laughed so much too. And there was just ... I don't even know if I was laughing because things were funny. I was laughing because things were just life, and I was just appreciating it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>We were all out of our element, and loving it, and-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It will never ... That's just so crazy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>That was great. Shooting on a moving train each day.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I know.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> We'd have to wake up. Our suits or our outfits would be prepared in the room with a microphone-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> In it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... in it. No makeup. No makeup period before going on a set. Just get your stuff, get dressed, and get to the train-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Train station.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... before the train departed, or else you missed the set.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>And nobody missed the set, right?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>No.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> What would we have done? What if-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> You couldn't have missed it?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I say Owen. What if I overslept? I could just see Owen, right?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> But you couldn't-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I thought I was-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I thought-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I dreamt that the alarm went off, and-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It was 9:30.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It was 9:30.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>But no, we had to literally leave the train station because it was a train station. We were trained on a live track. We weren't on some private track going up and down 40 feet. We were going through India, and I thought it was so smart how they built ... They had one long train, and they had built one side of it. The sets were on one side, and they built a replica of it on the other side. On the way back, when the sun would be on the other side, you just switched-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yes, switched seats.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> And it was just ... Yeah, to me-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> And the lighting is the same, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... and what I learned from that, that I loved so much was the responsibility that each actor has for each other, you know what I mean?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Because I remember there was a moment-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Oh, I remember too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... when you were like, I think your glasses ... You're like, I think your thing was here, looking out for each other. I just felt like this is amazing, you know what I mean? This is real, we are all doing this together.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Yeah. It was ... I'm an only child that felt like it was with my brothers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It was like that. No, I feel that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>It was a really-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah, it was our brothers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> ... touching journey and really fun. Poor you that Wes made you walk around all over India, barefoot. He's very brave. You really are ... We're all brave. You threw me down that river too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah, I was going to say-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> That didn't end well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, did not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It was probably better to walk around barefoot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It didn't, no.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It did not end well, no, no.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It was bad.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It was bad.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Wait. But, music ... Well, because music actually-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I was talking about music, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... was really interesting, because I remember during that time ... Well, for me, what was really interesting about that moment was I was so focused growing up on ... I was so into the British invasion, Beatles, and I missed a whole giant chunk of things. And I think that during that time, I had just gotten this computer, and I was learning how to ... It was beginning of me understanding-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Production.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: ... production and working. And I remember you came in and you played me a bunch of these beats you had done, and it was like really? It was like, okay, well this is what you can do.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Well, I feel the same way about this is what you can do if you can actually play instruments.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> No, no, but it was just like, I remember sitting there going, okay this is like ... And so, I still think about it, because I remember we sat there, and we were listening, and I was like, wow, all these little levels, and all these things, and I couldn't believe that it was just, you had just done it. And I still think back to that feeling of I'm not good yet still with the production, but that-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Was I making beats in India? Do you remember? Was I?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah. You came in and you played me.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, stuff I would make that I, because I usually, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: You played me 40 minutes of beats, and they were all great. And I remember just going like fuck, this is ... But, they weren't beats. They were songs. I mean they were like pieces of-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, they're beats, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, yeah, but they're-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> They're rudimentary. They're songs, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> But, to me, it's like when I'm imagine-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> They're compositions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>That's what I'm, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah, they're compositions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>To this day, you know how you have these weird memories. That's the one that I ... When I imagine getting good at being able to ... I'm not good at that yet to this day, but I think of that as-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> You don't have to, and that doesn't even have to be a style. But you always-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I want to be, but then I think of you a lot too, because we were talking about little DJ apps and things on the phone. I got a little DJ thing for my son and I."</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> A little portable rig? I have one of those.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It's like this big, little thing. It's pretty great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> They're great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It's not that portable. It's pretty portable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah. There's an even smaller one that's crazy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> There's a little thing-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>... this big. Yeah, that you plug into your-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> That's cool.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Okay. That's what I want.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> And I rocked a party with that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I rocked a whole show with great delays and effects-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... and everything. Yeah, so I'll turn you onto that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I watched the Questlove Masterclass on DJing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Did you? I saw it. I saw some of it, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>I liked it a lot. There was some really pretty interesting just watching-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I feel like you told me to see that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It was you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Oh, maybe, yeah. I liked his setup. I liked his setup. I liked his board. The one thing I'm trying to figure out though was, where is the mute? So many of these songs-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I'm a mess, what, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Well, so many of them are not there or available and I can't-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>They're all over the place.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> But I've also fallen deeply into working with one piece of equipment, and then, I will have a friend, or I'll go to Guitar Center or something and I'll see some new piece of gear, and I'll be like, oh, let me try that. And I'll start messing around with that. And then, I'll forget how to make music on that old equipment that I have-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... volumes of music on.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>And it's so-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I've got stuff. Yeah, I don't remember how ... I could probably figure out how to make a track on an ASR, but I was making beats on ASRs and EPS-16+'s, which are these old school EnSoniq-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Ensoniq, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... Ensoniq Keyboards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> The ASR10.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Back in the nineties.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ASR10.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ASR10.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>The ASR10. I still have one. I still have a full perfect-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Well, that's just-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Full 88 key ASR10.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah. I traveled to Jamaica with it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>No shit.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Now, you can go with your iPad and make amazing music.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Oh, my, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>But, I would travel with my ASR to Jamaica to visit my boys, and go there. And I remember making what, at the time, was, I felt, my masterpiece. I was cooking. And the problem with that, my model of it, when you had too many great layered samples, because it's a sampler sequencer, when there was too much in it, it would crash.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Oh, shit.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> And you had to save everything on a floppy disk. And I hadn't backed it up and oh, it didn't crash. It would crash. But, there was a thunderstorm, and the power fucking surged. And it went out after an eight-hour beat session that just was ... It's gone. It was probably my best work, honestly. It's gone.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> No, fuck me.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I may have cried.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I know I yelled, but I may have cried. It was that good. Anyway-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>How were you bringing your sample?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> In a giant roadie case? I’d go through luggage, and pick it up. Weighed a ton.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Isn't that interesting though, because I believe that .... And we're talking about acting with makeup or a character. I believe that instruments do have ... I believe they have songs in them in a way that you adapt to them. Oh, I find that I do.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Definitely, I don't know about a digital equipment, but I definitely would-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> A guitar.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: A guitar, or even a piano, or any kind of one instrument that would have a personality. It's made, it's that wood, someone assembled it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> But, the ASR10 is an example, I think, of a digital instrument that does analog-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It split analog with digital, yeah. It has a personality, yes, it does.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... but it has a personality, and it has a clock. And it has a way that it-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> I think Kanye does a lot of stuff still on the ASR.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, I know RZA did.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, right, no, that was the ... And even the APC, like the MPC 2000, if they have their own thing, and you make certain kind of thing on it, when you're saying-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: MPC does.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> And it's true that, that's the one thing I'm not good at either, is I don't know how to merge all my stuff. I have music on just different devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Me too, no, me too. You need to then-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Back it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... be serious. Well, you got to back it up. But, then you need to be serious, and you need to have time and money to be in a studio with someone to help you, like an engineer to say, "I want to upload all this on Pro Tools. That's great. I want to riff with that for a while, and just record it. And then, we can sample that riff, or play with" ... That's where I'm at these days with it, which I find really fulfilling. But I know it's time and money before-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Are you doing it?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I am. But, I'm not doing anything yet with things. But, I scored clean. I know. No, I know. Yeah, I made that whole left score, and I ended up doing it, because I was making beats while I made the movie. And I was like, wow, this is a theme. I made a theme in the state of mind of this character, and the zone I was in. And it was like this Rambo-esque kind of feeling. I was like, that's a theme. And then, ultimately, stuff I started making, even on an iPad. We ended up having an orchestra interpret, and had a woman playing-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> How cool is that?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... French horns, and cellos, and things. It was just amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: But, it was coming musically from the character in a way.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It was. It was coming from it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Isn't that interesting?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Fuck.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: But, you play a lot of acoustic work, which is so beautiful. And you sing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Well. I'm not a really good singer, but yeah, I play piano and guitar, enough to write and to play along with people.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: That's amazing. I can't do that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, I can't ... I wouldn't be like, pass me the guitar first thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It's soothing. I love the guitar.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It's soothing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: It's very nurturing. I used to carry a Martin backpacker just, and I can't play, other than a few little chords I can't play. But I love ... It's airy. It's a wooby. I love having it, it's like a nice blanket. It's just there.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah. Well, I think it's because the ... In my silly opinion, I think it's because when you're holding a guitar, the sound goes backwards too through your body. I think that's a nice-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Reverberation?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, I think there's a real-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It comes in and-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah, even when you're tuning something, when they're out of tune, you go, woob, woob, woob, woob, woob, woob, woob. And then, as they get more in tune, they go woob, woob, woob, woob, woob, woob. And I love that. It's how I feel when we're all working, it's tuning, and it's like, woob, woob, woob. And it's not that it's bad if it's out of tune, but you can feel it-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: When it's aligned.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> You can feel it go, ja, ja, foom, poom, poom. And I lived for that moment. That's what I live for. It's like the tuning of people.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>I like that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>I was just at Guitar Center yesterday.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>Really?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Yeah. Just got to make you jealous-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> That's fun. I'm jealous. Yeah. You got a new keyboard?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It's pretty sick.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> There's a bunch of gear out now.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I know. There's so much stuff I want. There's a great place in LA where they have a lot of synths if you want good synths. But, I love all the gear too much.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: How's the family, the babies?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: They're great, they're great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Adult children help everybody now?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> My daughter just turned 14.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: 14?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> It's really funny. I have a ten-year-old. I said, I'm leaving this last night. I said, "I'm going out to see this movie." She said, "I go too." "No, no."</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: No, not you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: You don't go see this one. And I'm like, listen, you could barely make it through Wild Robot. You're not going to get through the Brutal. But then, while I was watching, I was going, "Shit, they would love this movie, because it's so fucking beautiful and intense." And the music, by the way, is incredible.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Oh, and that is incredible.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> And that is a real achievement, that score by the way. And seeing it last night on the big screen, it was great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> No, the music is just epic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: Yeah, it was fun, by the way, just to say it, last night, to sit in a theater that was clearly ... With that kind of, with strangers was fun, because you realize how I'm just talking and sharing my ... And the people next to me are just talking about how they feel.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Oh, how great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: We don't even know each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> How great.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> But that's a great movie, right-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> ... where it's like you're compelled to just like, what do you think? What's going on? You start talking and it's like, that's what a movie ... That's a great feeling, right?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> It is, yeah.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: It's just like the community, the people in the room-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>... all wanting to just start to talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>That's wonderful.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>And that was like-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody: </strong>That makes me really happy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I was like, what a triumph. I was like, this is what it's all about. And to me, it's just like, everything you do is so great. I'm just so happy that this movie is like-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Yeah, but I think that this one has some-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>It has something-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody:</strong> Really special.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman: </strong>Yeah, and it's ... I don't know how you did it, but, anyway-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Should we say do some closing?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Next question. Question number two.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: I've enjoyed-</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>: I've loved it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: ... chatting with you, pal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>Adrien Brody</strong>: Cheers. Rock and roll.</p>
